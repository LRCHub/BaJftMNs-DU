Leather skin
Lately it's what I've been thinking about
This alien girl from above
We can share our love
I got it good for a woman
She's something else
She's not quite human [Repeat x2]
Human
Venusian queen
You're so bright the sun gets me
I swear it's a dream
But I pinch myself and your still green
I got it good for a woman
She's something else
She's not quite human [Repeat x2]
I'm head over heals for this space case
Something rhymes and no one fades
I got it good for a woman
She's something else
She's not quite human [Repeat x2]
My head's spinning
Around the world and back again [Repeat x2]
I got it good for a woman
She's something else
She's not quite human [Repeat x2]
