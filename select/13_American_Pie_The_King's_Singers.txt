A long, long time ago, I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe, they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing, â€½This'll be the day that I dieâ€
â€½This'll be the day that I dieâ€

Now for ten years, we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book of Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

And we were singing, â€½Bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing, â€½This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I dieâ€

Oh and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on, Jack, be nimble, Jack, be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the Devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

And he was singing, â€½Bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing, â€½This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I dieâ€

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells, all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son and The Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

And They were singing, â€½Bye-bye, Miss American Pieâ€
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing, â€This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I dieâ€

Bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing, â€½This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I dieâ€
Singing, â€½This'll be the day that I dieâ€
